1. Write a short outline of your approach and any assumptions made on the build task.

a) Bar Chart - I did a d3 nest() to filter the data on Campaign and Clicked. Then did a loop thru the resultant object and 
    sort the data to show the Jan data first and then the Xmas data. The bar chart is rendered using barChart()

b) Donut Chart - Here also I filtered the csv data using the d3 nest(). Used transition for animation. The Donut
    chart is rendered using donutChart() function.

Used bootstrap to display the grid and panel.

2. Explain how you would host the webpage and which technologies and frameworks you would use.
Give reasons for your choices.

The D3 js library is directly added to the head of the index.html file. If this needs to be displayed while offline, then 
we can download the d3.js and add it to assets/js file and reference it in the index.html. I used Vanila Javascript
to display the charts. I think if we can display the charts in Vanilla JS, then it can be displayed using any JS
framework.

3. Briefly describe how you would structure and scale your webpage if more content was to be added.

If more content were to be added, I would make my JS more modular and separate each chart as separate file and
load via ajax when the page loads
